## 🧭 Stakeholder Requirement
This dataset contains details of referrals and discharges for a community healthcare service over a six-month period.  
The stakeholder requested an analysis to support the service in evaluating performance against the following targets:

- **Waiting Times Target:** Patients should begin treatment within **18 weeks** of referral.  
- **Recovery Target:** At least **50%** of discharged patients should achieve recovery.  

The analysis should highlight key insights, trends, and data quality issues, using Power BI visualizations to support evidence-based recommendations.  
This document summarizes the findings from the Power BI dashboard created to address these stakeholder requirements.
