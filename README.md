## 🧭 Stakeholder Requirement
This dataset contains details of referrals and discharges for a community healthcare service over a six-month period.  
The stakeholder requested an analysis to support the service in evaluating performance against the following targets:

- **Waiting Times Target:** Patients should begin treatment within **18 weeks** of referral.  
- **Recovery Target:** At least **50%** of discharged patients should achieve recovery.  

The analysis should highlight key insights, trends, and data quality issues, using Power BI visualizations to support evidence-based recommendations.  
This document summarizes the findings from the Power BI dashboard created to address these stakeholder requirements.

## 1️⃣ Treatment Commencement Completeness
**Insight:**  
Of **11,501 total patients**, only **7,954 (69.16%)** had a recorded treatment commencement date, leaving **30.84% unrecorded**. This suggests that nearly one-third of patient treatment data is incomplete, which can impact performance tracking, care continuity, and accurate reporting on treatment initiation rates. This incomplete data impedes accurate performance analysis.

**Recommendation:**  
- Enforce mandatory data capture for treatment commencement.  
- Introduce dashboards to flag missing treatment start records.  
- Conduct staff retraining on data entry and process compliance.
